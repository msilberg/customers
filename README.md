Customers
=========

My examination on Zend Framework

Within this work I have created Customers Module with two Entities - Customer and Call.

In order to install a database you need to create one with name and user details as shown in this file /config/autoload/doctrine.local.php and import 'database.sql.import' file.

In order to pass an authorization while opening an index page for the first time, yoo need to enter username ('customer') and password ('qwerty').

On the client side I created js/customers.js which runs all client side functionality including AJAX.
